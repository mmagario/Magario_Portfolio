			<h2> Projects </h2>
				<h3>UI/UX Prototyping and Animation</h3>
					<p><b><u>Background</b></u>: Diminished 3rd Studio is a compact, independent game development studio dedicated to crafting video games that are both visually and narratively dark and impressive.
						<br><br>
						<b><u>Problem</b></u>: Create an animated logo intro & mock-up UI/UX system for a video game concept.
						<br><br>
						<b><u>Process</b></u>: I designed the logo inspired by a Russian nesting doll to reflect the Studio's aim of developing games featuring nested worlds. I explored logos and intro animations from other game studios for inspiration. For the UI/UX, I chose a 1950s Art Deco style, aligning with the game world's setting, and studied various game UIs to understand their interactivity.
						<br><br>
						<b><u>Results</b></u>: The logo and its introductory animation effectively capture the theme of the client's game concept and the studio's identity. The UI/UX mock-up successfully illustrates a potential game interface for the project.
						<br><br><br><br>
					</p>
				<h3>Beat the Heat Beatbox Event</h3>
					<p><b><u>Background</b></u>: Arizona Beatbox is a community-based group that organizes events and competitions for beatboxers, artists, and enthusiasts alike.
						<br><br>
						
						<b><u>Problem</b></u>: Rebrand Arizona Beatbox, including a logo redesign & create promotional materials (Awards, Banners, Lanyards, and Stickers).
						<br><br>
						
						<b><u>Process</b></u>: I investigated other brands that matched the desired vibe and examined materials inspired by beatboxing and urban art. I began by redesigning the logo, iterating through multiple designs until I developed a strong concept. Once the client approved the logo, I proceeded to work on the accompanying collateral.
						<br><br>
						
						<b><u>Results</b></u>: A fresh design that resonates with the culture that birthed beatboxing was developed, resulting in a successful new logo and supporting collateral. These elements not only met the clients' expectations but also significantly contributed to the success of their event, ensuring it was both engaging and fruitful.
						<br><br><br><br>

				<h3>What is GIT? - Team Project</h3>
					<p><b><u>Background</b></u>: The Graphic Information Technology program at Arizona State University is housed within the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. This program offers a blend of disciplines that prepare students for careers in digital and print graphics, photography, video, and web design. 
						<br><br>
					<b><u>Problem</b></u>: Produce a video that creatively and entertainingly explains what GIT is, incorporating various skills from each focus area of GIT.
					<br><br>
					<b><u>Process</b></u>: After receiving the storyboard crafted by another team member, I took responsibility for creating the character concepts. In developing these concepts, I extensively utilized Photoshop to bring the 2D backgrounds and characters to life, ensuring they aligned with the established storyboard. I also explored various animation styles and techniques to enhance visual storytelling. The seamless integration of the character models into 3D, handled by another team member, and the dynamic animation possibilities in After Effects influenced my creative choices significantly. Ultimately, the final video was skillfully edited in Premiere by another teammate, bringing our collaborative vision to fruition.  
					<br><br>
					<b><u>Results</b></u>: The video presents an introduction to GIT and its various segments in an engaging and enjoyable manner. As a team, we opted to gamify the video's style to captivate our target audience. The client was delighted with the final product and appreciated the innovative concept.
